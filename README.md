# SmashDB
This program accepts user input about a Super Smash Bros. character, such as their name, franchise, and signature move, and records this information in a file, which can be accessed at any point via this same program. This is essentially a database for Super Smash Bros. characters! Sample character files have been provided for use with the program.
